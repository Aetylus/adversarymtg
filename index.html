<p>The MSE Sets are additional sets exclusively featuring cards created in Magic Set Editor. They have lighter requirements for Adversaries to be accepted, allowing people to play with their custom Adversaries soon after they are initially pitched.</p>

<p>Current Adversaries: 40+

<hr>

<p>Not sure how to find Adversaries once you've got them downloaded?
Besides searching for their names, you can also use a Filtered search in Cockatrice. Search for the 'Adversary' card type, or the set name of your chosen packs.</p>

<a id="rules-list" class="anchor" href="#rules-list" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RULES LIST</h1>

<ul>
<li>RULE ONE: Adversaries are not permanents, but they can still tap for convenience.</li>
<li>RULE TWO: An Adversary's starting hand size is also considered their maximum hand size.</li>
<li>RULE THREE: All players have one free mulligan (a free mulligan means drawing a new starting hand without reducing your starting hand size).</li>
<li>RULE FOUR: Decks should be exactly 61 cards in size, including your Adversary, but this is only a softrule.</li>
<li>RULE FIVE: Do not build your deck specifically to exploit infinite combos. The punishment for breaking this rule is simply making everyone stop playing with you, because it can get annoying.</li>
<li>RULE SIX: The format is Legacy Singleton, pending reconsideration.</li>
</ul>

<a id="frequently-asked-questions" class="anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<p>Q. Isn't this just a rip-off of Vanguard?
A. Yes, although it's less of an attempt to plagiarize it and more of an attempt to revive it with the addition of custom cards and more finely tuned balancing.</p>

<p>Q. Is there an easy way to check if my Cockatrice deck is Modern legal?
Yes. In the deck builder, click Deck Editor &gt; Analyze deck on deckstats.net, then scroll to the bottom. It will tell you if your deck is Modern legal or Legacy legal. If it's Legacy legal, you can then scroll through your decklist to find all the cards that are listed as Legacy legal.</p>

<p>Q. Does Velan gain life when her creatures damage an opponent?
A. Yes. Damage counts as life loss (although life loss does not count as damage).</p>

<p>Q. Where does Deus summon his other Adversaries from?
A. They are placed in the sideboard.</p>

<a id="level-guideline" class="anchor" href="#level-guideline" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LEVEL GUIDELINE</h1>

<p>This is a guide detailing what it means for an Adversary to be at a certain Level. The Playable VS. Range indicates which Adversary levels it is 'safe' to play with, in that the matchup isn't so imbalanced as to be unplayable. Bear in mind that this isn't always correct; some Adversaries can be direct counters to others. A Level 1 Adversary may be able to destroy a Level 5 Adversary with the right ability.</p>

<h2>
<a id="level-1" class="anchor" href="#level-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Level 1</h2>

<p>The most balanced Adversaries. Gameplay is nearly unaltered.
Playable VS. Range: 1-2</p>

<h2>
<a id="level-2" class="anchor" href="#level-2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Level 2</h2>

<p>Provide a noticeable advantage, while still being fair.
Playable VS. Range: 1-3</p>

<h2>
<a id="level-3" class="anchor" href="#level-3" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Level 3</h2>

<p>Gameplay is significantly altered. Non-Adversary decks no longer stand a chance.
Playable VS. Range: 2-4 or multiple 1's.</p>

<h2>
<a id="level-4" class="anchor" href="#level-4" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Level 4</h2>

<p>Incredibly powerful. Gameplay is no longer recognizable.
Playable VS. Range: 3-4 or multiple 2's.</p>

<h2>
<a id="level-5" class="anchor" href="#level-5" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Level 5</h2>

<p>Don't even try.
Playable VS. Range: 5 or multiple 3-4's.</p>
